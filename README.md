# Automated-Parts-Renderer
A Blender addon that automates the rendering of product thumbnail images. This application was designed to support the business processes of B2B companies within manufacturing.

It supports rendering from different viewpoints, file options, camera options, and other aesthetic options such as background.

There is also an image selector tool for choosing only the best images for each product and omitting unwanted ones in a user-friendly manner.
